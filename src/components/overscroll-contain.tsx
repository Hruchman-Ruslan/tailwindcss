        Well, let me tell you something, funny boy. Y&apos;know that little
        stamp, the one that says &quot;New York Public Library&quot;? Well that
        may not mean anything to you, but that means a lot to me. One whole hell
        of a lot. Sure, go ahead, laugh if you want to. I&apos;ve seen your type
        before: Flashy, making the scene, flaunting convention. Yeah, I know
        what you&apos;re thinking. What&apos;s this guy making such a big stink
        about old library books? Well, let me give you a hint, junior. Maybe we
        can live without libraries, people like you and me. Maybe. Sure,
        we&apos;re too old to change the world, but what about that kid, sitting
        down, opening a book, right now, in a branch at the local library and
        finding drawings of pee-pees and wee-wees on the Cat in the Hat and the
        Five Chinese Brothers? Doesn&apos;t HE deserve better?
